# Security Policy

We take security seriously at the Computational Science based on HPC Physics_LIB repository. This file outlines some security measures and best practices to ensure the safety and integrity of the code and its users. If you discover any security vulnerabilities or concerns, please report them to our team immediately.

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.4.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.4   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any security vulnerabilities or concerns within the codebase, please report them to our team by emailing jghaly00@gmail.com. Provide us with detailed information about the issue, including steps to reproduce and any relevant technical details. We will acknowledge your report and work with you to address the issue promptly.

Please refrain from disclosing any security-related issues publicly until we have had an opportunity to investigate and address them properly.

## Secure Coding Practices

To maintain the security of the repository, we follow these secure coding practices:

1. Input Validation: We perform thorough input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and remote code execution.

2. Authentication and Authorization: We enforce proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized individuals can access sensitive resources and perform privileged actions.

3. Secure Communication: We use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data in transit and prevent eavesdropping or tampering.

4. Regular Updates: We regularly update dependencies, libraries, and frameworks used in the project to incorporate security patches and bug fixes.

5. Code Reviews: We conduct code reviews to identify potential security vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to secure coding practices.

## Handling Security Vulnerabilities

When a security vulnerability is identified, we follow a defined process to address it:

1. Analysis: Our team promptly reviews the reported vulnerability and assesses its impact and severity.

2. Fixing: We develop and test a fix for the vulnerability, ensuring it effectively resolves the issue.

3. Disclosure: Once the vulnerability is patched, we coordinate the disclosure of the vulnerability with the reporter and relevant stakeholders to provide users with information about the issue and the updated version.

4. Security Updates: We release security updates and notify users to encourage them to update to the latest secure version of the codebase.

## Reporting Security Incidents

If you encounter any security incidents or unauthorized access to the repository, please contact our team immediately at jghaly00@gmail.com. We will investigate and take appropriate actions to address the incident promptly.

Remember, security is a collaborative effort, and we appreciate your cooperation in keeping the Computational Science based on HPC Physics_LIB repository secure. Thank you for your support!
Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
